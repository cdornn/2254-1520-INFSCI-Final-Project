# 2254-1520-INFSCI-Final-Project

This is my final project submission for the University of Pittsburgh's 2254 INFSCI 1520 course.

Overall, I wanted to explore the best times and places to catch trout during the trout season in New York. 
Had I found a decent dataset with the proper coordinates, I would have also made a map of streams/rivers that were stocked
